For all designs we make together, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Lets make polished webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

When using client side hooks (useState and useEffect) in a component that's being treated as a Server Component by Next.js, always add the "use client" directive at the top of the file.

Stay away from code that causes this error, "Warning: Extra attributes from the server: %s%s""class,style"

Lets not forget to run the occasional "tsc" (typescript compiler) during development so we can catch errors during the compilation phase.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, the shadcn/ui library, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist.
